# AlphaPulse MLOps Project Execution Plan

**Objective**: Transform AlphaPulse into a high-conviction portfolio project demonstrating Senior-level MLOps and Backend Engineering skills.

---

## Phase 1: Narrative Injection (Professional Realism)
*Goal: Make the system feel alive and technically sophisticated.*

1.  **[x] Professional Log Implementation**: Replace mock logs with high-depth engineering entries (Inference latency, Kafka lag, GC pauses, Drift alerts).
2.  **[-] README Overhaul**: (Skipped/Reverted by User request).
3.  **[-] Memory Synchronization**: (Skipped).

## Phase 2: Functional Polish (UI/UX Depth)
*Goal: Fix logic gaps and expose the architectural complexity.*

4.  **[x] Admin Dashboard Link Repair**: Update placeholder `#` links in `App.tsx` to realistic microservice ports (e.g., 3000, 5000, 8080).
5.  **[x] Architecture Blueprint Restoration**: Uncomment and optimize the "System Blueprint" (Mermaid diagram) in the dashboard.
6.  **[x] Feature Precision**: Ensure the "Market Live" indicator and pricing font-scaling are consistent across all views.

## Phase 3: Final Verification & Delivery
*Goal: Ensure production readiness and clean codebase.*

7.  **[x] Type-Safety Check**: Run `tsc` and `npm run build` to verify no breaking changes in the frontend.
8.  **[x] Commit & Document**: Perform an atomic Git commit and update any final documentation.

**Current Status**: Mission Accomplished.
